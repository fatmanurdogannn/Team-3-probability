# IE 221 Probability - Teamwork 3

## Project Description
This project aims to experimentally verify the **Strong Law of Large Numbers (SLLN)** and the **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** through computer simulations. Additionally, it demonstrates a practical application of SLLN using the **Monte Carlo Method** for estimating the value of $\pi$.

## Project Structure
The repository is organized according to the project requirements:
* **src/**: Contains all simulation source codes (`slln_simulation.py`, `clt_simulation.py`, `monte_carlo_pi.py`).
* **results/figures/**: Stores all generated plots in PNG format.
* **reports/**: Technical reports and documentation.
* **requirements.txt**: List of necessary Python libraries.

## Installation
To set up the environment and install the required dependencies, use the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
